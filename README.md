# blackbox_for_optimization
 creating blackbox for optimization with different methods like Newton, BFGS and Steepest Decent.
 For this code you have to provide 3 things. 
 1) function
 2) gradient of the function
 3) hessian of the function

 I have provided one test function to test the code.

I will improve this code to work with functions with errors (probabilistic) and try to minimize it.
